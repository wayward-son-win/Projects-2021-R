        A beverage as black as ink, useful against numerous illnesses, particularly those of the stomach.
        Its consumers take it in the morning, quite frankly, in a porcelain cup that is passed around and from which
        each one drinks a cupful. It is composed of water and the fruit from a bush called bunnu.

        <P>By the 16th century, coffee had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and northern Africa. The
            first coffee seeds were smuggled out of the Middle East by Sufi Baba Budan from Yemen to the Indian
            subcontinent during the time. Before then, all exported coffee was boiled or otherwise sterilised. Portraits
            of Baba Budan depict him as having smuggled seven coffee seeds by strapping them to his chest. The first
            plants grown from these smuggled seeds were planted in Mysore.</p>

        <p>Coffee had spread to Italy by 1600, and then to the rest of Europe, Indonesia, and the Americas.</p>

            Washington in 1909. In 1583, Leonhard Rauwolf, a German physician, gave this description of coffee after
            returning from a ten-year trip to the Near East.</P>
